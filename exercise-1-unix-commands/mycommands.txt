    Start by creating a directory (folder) where all the exercise files will be placed.
    You decide where, but a good place would be on your desktop, or in your document directory.

    // mkdir unix_commands

    Create a file with the name to_be_deleted.txt

    // touch to_be_deleted.txt

    delete the file to_be_deleted.txt

    // rm to_be_deleted.txt
 
    Move the 3 exercise files into this directory.

    // mv ex1.acc ex1.dat orphans.sp .. 

    Use a text editor (VS Code is good choise) to create a file called mycommands.txt 
    where you write all commands and observations you do in the following exercises.
    Use copy/paste to copy the commands. from the terminal to your text file.

    // touch mycommands.txt

    First list the files in the directory.

    // ls

    Copy ex1.acc to myfile.acc.

    // cp ex1.acc myfile.acc

    Look at the content of both files to ensure they are identical.

    Copy ex1.dat to myfile.acc.

    // cp ex1.dat myfile.acc

    Check that the content of myfile.acc changed.

    Delete myfile.acc.

    // rm myfile.acc

    Make a directory test and move the three files to it.

    // mkdir test && mv ex1.acc ex1.dat orphans.sp ./test

    Make a directory data and move the three files to that instead.

    // mkdir data && mv test/ex1.acc test/ex1.dat test/orphans.sp ./data

    Remove test directory.

    // rmdir test/

    Change directory to data and confirm that you succeded.

    // cd data/ && ls 

    Go back to the home directory or work directory afterwards.

    // cd ..

    Make three new directories “newtest” - one inside the other, like a russian doll.

    // mkdir test && mkdir ./test/test && mkdir ./test/test/test

    Move the data directory to the innermost “newtest” directory.

    // mv data/ test/test/test/

    Confirm that the three files are moved along with the data directory.

    // ls test/test/test/data/

    Copy the three files to your home (your top directory).

    // cp test/test/test/data/{ex1.acc,ex1.dat,orphans.sp} ./

    Remove all newtest directories and data in the with a single command.

    // rm -r test/

    Count the lines in ex1.acc and ex1.dat.

    // awk 'END{print NR}' ex1.acc && awk 'END{print NR}' ex1.dat

    Concatenate ex1.acc and ex1.dat in the file ex1.tot, i.e. copy the content of two files into one new file. 
    Verify that all gene IDs comes first followed by numerical data.

    // cat ex1.acc ex1.dat > ex1.tot

    Merge/Paste ex1.acc and ex1.dat together in ex1.tot, thus destroying the old file.
    Verify that corresponding gene IDs and numerical data are put on the same line. as the data.

    // cat ex1.acc | tr -d '\r' > ex1.acc && cat ex1.dat | tr -d '\r' > ex1.dat
    // paste ex1.acc ex1.dat > ex1.tot

    Extract (cut) SwissProt ID and 3rd numerical data (column 1 and 5) from ex1.tot. Put results into a file ex1.res.

    // cut -f 1,5 ex1.tot > ex1.res

    Find the 3 SwisProt ID’s in ex1.res which have the largest number(s) in column 2, i.e. the top 3 entries.

    // sort -k 2 -r ex1.res | head -3
